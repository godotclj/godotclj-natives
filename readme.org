These implement Clojure bindings for the godot engine.

See https://github.com/tristanstraub/thecreeps-godotclj to see how to use it.

This is not production quality.

* java properties (e.g. via JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS)

  godotclj.config.path: location of edn config file (default: 'godotclj.edn')
  godotclj.godot.path: path to godot executable (default: 'godot')

  You can override these properties as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dgodotclj.config.path=$DIR/../godotclj-test.edn

  clj -M -e "(require 'godotclj.runner) (godotclj.runner/start \"-v\")"
#+END_SRC
